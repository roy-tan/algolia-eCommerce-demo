_This project was generated with [create-instantsearch-app](https://github.com/algolia/create-instantsearch-app) by [Algolia](https://algolia.com)._

## Get started

To run this project locally, install the dependencies and run the local server:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Alternatively, you may use [Yarn](https://http://yarnpkg.com/):

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to see your app.

This app is based on [E-Commerce InstantSearch.js](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/resources/demos/js/#e-commerce)
Dataset used is [records.json](https://github.com/algolia/datasets/blob/master/ecommerce/records.json)

Ideally, I will like to integrate [Autocomplete with InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/ui-libraries/autocomplete/guides/using-instantsearch/) however I was not able to retrieve the suggestions which I assume that it is due to missing configurations.
